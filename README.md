Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing:
 - Models key-value binding and custom events,
 - Collections with a rich API of enumerable functions.
 - Views with declarative event handling.
Plus it connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.
